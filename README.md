## Description
This repository provides the MATLAB implementation of the **ε-Neighborhood Model (ε-NM)**, a classifier based on the **k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm** and **semantic cell models**.

### Files Included:
- **testENM.m**: Tests the **ε-NM** by evaluating its classification performance on a test dataset using the trained parameters.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB **R2013a or later**
