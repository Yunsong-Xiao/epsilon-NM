## Description
This repository provides the MATLAB implementation of the **ε-Neighborhood Model (ε-NM)**, a classifier based on the **k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm** and **semantic cell models**.

### Files Included:
- **trainENM.m**: A function that trains the **ε-NM** classifier using a training dataset and returns the learned model parameters.
- **testENM.m**: A function that tests the **ε-NM** classifier on a test dataset and returns the classification accuracy using the trained model parameters.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB **R2013a or later**
